					"description": "Now if the World is not of type HDRi Maker, the usual menu appears in the HDRi Maker World panel, with a button called TRY TO CONVERT, this operator, attempts to convert any World to an HDRi Maker Wordl.

					"title": "Added - Reload Dome Image",
					"description": "A new Reload Image button has been added to the Dome menu.

This works provided that in the World Added to the scene, there is an HDR or EXR image inside the World nodes."

				"4": {
					"title": "Improvement - Save the Expansion Library directories",
					"description": "When you update the addon from version 3.x and up of HDRi Maker, the addon now also saves the directories and names of the Expansion Library, so that if you update the addon, you do not have to re-indicate the paths of the Expansion Library. Now all directories are stored in a json file, in order to simplify the update phase of the addon. Even when you switch to a later version of Blender, the addon always recognizes the directories, as long as they still exist and have not been moved on the computer to another location"

Now everything should work from Blender 3.0 and up. Previous versions have been abandoned, as they are now obsolete. a positive note for the support of Blender 3.3 which is an LTS release, so it is necessary to make HDRi Maker workable on it."
